# SDK Style Guide

ReXGlue upstream remains the baseline for SDK code style. This page records the
maintained ReRevved fork's local conventions and scope. Apply it to maintained
SDK code and documentation; generated and third-party content follows its own
source and ownership rules.

The canonical policy and configuration files are:

- [Upstream contributing guide](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk/wiki/Development/Contributing)
  for prerequisites, contribution workflow, and upstream conventions.
- [Maintaining the ReRevved fork](MAINTAINING.md) for upstream integration,
  branch, artifact, and release policy.
- [`.clang-format`](../.clang-format), [`.clang-tidy`](../.clang-tidy),
  [`.cmake-format.yaml`](../.cmake-format.yaml), and
  [`.editorconfig`](../.editorconfig) for mechanical formatting and lint rules.

## C++

### Names and files

- Use lower snake case for namespaces, source and header filenames, and
  directories. Use the existing namespace spelling in the surrounding module;
  both nested namespace blocks and C++17 nested namespace syntax are present
  in retained upstream and newer fork code.
- Use `CamelCase` for classes, structs, enums, functions, methods, and type
  aliases. Use lower snake case for local variables, parameters, and data
  members. Private and class data members generally carry a trailing `_`;
  public value structs such as [`AssetOverlayPackage`](../include/rex/system/asset_overlay_catalog.h)
  expose bare snake_case fields. Existing accessors also use snake_case in
  retained upstream APIs; preserve those public names.
- Use a `k` prefix with `CamelCase` for new constants and enum values. Existing
  public enums include older bare `CamelCase` values, so preserve their names.
  Use `UPPER_CASE` for macro definitions.
- Keep the `rex` root namespace for SDK facilities. Title-specific behavior
  belongs in the title repository rather than in a general SDK module.

### Formatting

- Use C++23 as selected by the CMake project. Indent with two spaces and never
  use tabs. Use attached braces (`if (...) {`) and `Type* value` or `Type& value`
  pointer and reference placement.
- Keep source lines within the configured 100-column limit. Let clang-format
  handle continuation indentation and wrapping; it uses four spaces for
  continuations, aligned brackets, and packed arguments and parameters where
  they fit.
- Preserve the local include order. `.clang-format` keeps include sorting off,
  regroups include blocks, and defines the repository's categories: the main
  header, C and C++ standard headers, platform headers, third-party headers,
  then `<rex/...>` headers.
- Keep short inline functions in the form accepted by `.clang-format`. Match
  nearby retained upstream code for one-line control statements and empty
  virtual hooks; use a block when the body or its reason needs room.

### Comments

Use short inline comments for one enum value, field, list, local invariant,
lifetime rule, platform detail, or compatibility constraint. Put a shared
explanation immediately above the group it describes. Put longer contracts in
the relevant public header or this guide, then link that canonical explanation
from entry-point documentation. Keep a `TODO` or `FIXME` with the affected code
when an action is still required. Preserve existing upstream license, copyright,
and provenance blocks in retained files.

### Headers and APIs

Headers under `include/rex` and the exported CMake package are public SDK
surface. Keep public headers small, stable, and self-sufficient: include what a
declaration directly needs, use `#pragma once`, and forward declare only when
that keeps the dependency boundary clear. Document non-obvious API behavior,
ownership, thread or lifetime requirements, and error results at the
declaration. Check [Maintaining the ReRevved fork](MAINTAINING.md) and the
[release rules](RELEASING.md) before changing public API or ABI contracts.

### Errors and ownership

- Use `rex::Result<T>` or `rex::VoidResult` with `rex::Error` for operations
  that need structured failure. Return `rex::Ok(...)` or `rex::Err(...)` and
  propagate an error early with the existing `TRY` helper where it fits the
  surrounding API.
- Preserve established boundary contracts. Existing modules return `bool`,
  platform status values, or subsystem result enums where those APIs already
  use them. Use the repository assertion helpers for violated invariants and
  `FatalError` only for paths that must terminate.
- Return `std::unique_ptr` from factories that transfer one owner. Use
  `std::shared_ptr` where the current API has a shared lifetime, as with the
  console presentation sink. Pass borrowed references, spans, and views when
  the surrounding API does so; make ownership and lifetime clear at public
  declarations.

## CMake and scripts

- Format CMake with two spaces, a 100-column line width, lower-case command
  names, and upper-case keywords as configured in [`.cmake-format.yaml`](../.cmake-format.yaml).
  Keep platform and test configuration in `CMakePresets.json` and use existing
  targets and options rather than introducing ad hoc build commands.
- PowerShell scripts use four spaces and LF line endings. Shell scripts use two
  spaces and LF line endings. The `scripts/PSReX` module is the supported
  wrapper for configure, build, test, install, format, lint, and setup commands.
- Keep generator and build logic in CMake or the existing script entry points.
  Keep source comments focused on the local reason; put reusable command
  explanations in this guide or the owning build document.

## Generated and vendored code

Files marked `Auto-generated` or `DO NOT EDIT` are outputs. Change their source
template or generator instead. This includes the CMake-configured
`include/rex/version.h`, embedded templates, PPC test outputs, and generated
project/codegen files. Build output belongs under `out/` or the configured build
tree and is not committed.

The `thirdparty/` tree contains vendored dependencies. Preserve each
dependency's attribution, license, and submodule boundary; update it through
the dependency's own process. Project formatting and lint checks cover
maintained `include`, `src`, and `tests` files, not vendored source.

## Verification

Use the narrowest existing check for the changed surface. From PowerShell,
import the module before using its aliases:

```powershell
Import-Module .\scripts\PSReX
```

For a source or header edit, `rex-format` formats in place. Use
`rex-format -All` for all maintained C/C++ files or pass explicit paths for a
bounded edit. The read-only CI and pre-commit checks use
`clang-format --dry-run --Werror`; `cmake-format --check` is used for staged
CMake files when `cmake-format` is installed. `rex-lint` is read-only and
requires the compile database produced by `rex-configure`; it applies
[`.clang-tidy`](../.clang-tidy) to `include` and `src`. The formatter resolves
the pinned version from [`scripts/requirements-dev.txt`](../scripts/requirements-dev.txt).

For a build or SDK behavior change, the PowerShell aliases are:

```powershell
rex-configure
rex-build -Config Release
rex-test -Config Release
rex-install
rex-lint
```

Documentation-only edits need link inspection and `git diff --check`; they do
not require an SDK build, install, source formatter, or source lint run.

For a full SDK validation run, the direct CMake and CTest entry points are:

```text
cmake --preset <platform> -DREXGLUE_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build out/build/<platform> --config Release
ctest --preset <platform>-release --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
cmake --install out/build/<platform> --config Release
```

The supported `<platform>` and CTest preset names are defined in
[`CMakePresets.json`](../CMakePresets.json). For Unix changes to mod loading,
also run:

```text
ctest --preset <platform>-release -R '^mod_plugin\.' --output-on-failure --no-tests=error
```

The [lint workflow](../.github/workflows/lint.yaml) is the CI formatting gate.
The [platform workflow](../.github/workflows/_build-platform.yaml) is the
canonical build, install, and test sequence.
